# Matcha

Matcha is the second project of the web branch at 42. The goal is to do a dating webapp, we are free to choose the languages / frameworks we want, but many tools are still forbidden (like object-relational mapping).

I was working with a friend on this project. We both wanted to learn something new so I went for React (as he already was comfortable with it) and he went for Neo4j, a graph oriented database.


## Starting the project

You can check the app here: matchapi.guillaumerx.fr

Othervise you can run these commands

```
git clone https://github.com/nicovrg/matcha.git
cd matcha/front
yarn start
```

It should open a new tab in your browser with localhost/3000 in the url
If it does not open in your browser you can do it manually (it could be some other port if 3000 is already used)
